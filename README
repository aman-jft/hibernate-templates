# Hibernate Templates without Spring

Added hibernate and h2 dependencies. Added an Entity class : User. Had a configuration in resources. There is one utility class : HibernateTemplate which is kind of homemade template which will execute query. I have used java 8 function interface to implement template pattern. 
 
	public static void runQuery(SessionFactory sf, Consumer<Session> consumer) {
		Session session = sf.openSession();      	// Open a new session.
		session.beginTransaction();			
		consumer.accept(session);			// Here query runs.
		session.getTransaction().commit();
		session.close();
	}


It is somehow similar to what Spring does in templating. However Spring has lot of things beneficial out of the box like data access exception hierarchy, DAO support class and a easy way to execute queries. Then lets see it with Spring templates.
